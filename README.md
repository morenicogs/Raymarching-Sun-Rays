For this challenge I really wanted to come at it from the idea of perspective. Living in Belgium I did not notice anything from the eclipse while my friends in the US most certainly did. 
The animation that was created was so mesmerizing that I got carried away from the initial challenge, but I did want to share the results with you all. 

You can interpret this as what is visible to someone at a given point or what light beams would be casted from a point. Here are some examples:

How it works: 
It creates a circle with as radius the closest distance to an object and does the same thing for a point on that circle.
